#### 01 C Home

C is a general-purpose programming language, developed in 1972, and still
quite popular. C is very powerful; it has been used to develop operating
systems, databases, applications, etc.

Example

#include <stdio.h> - header file library that lets us work with input and 
                     output functions, such as printf()
main() - function, code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed
printf() - function used to output/print text to the screen
return 0 - ends the main() function
